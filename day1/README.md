there are any third party libraries can be used with node.js projects. These third party libraries can be installed on our system

steps:

1) Create a folder
2) Open folder in terminal
3) execute 'npm init -y'
when you run the above step, a package.json file will be created
4) we have to search in npm repository what third party library we require
5) We can install that 3rd party library by using 'npm install' command
we can [npm install --save-dev jest] so jest will not be part of the final bundled module used for deployment
